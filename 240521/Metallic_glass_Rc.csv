They have also shown that, for some typical non-BMG systems, γ values in the order of 0.335 corresponds to very high critical cooling rates - reaching as high as 10^(7) ˚C.s>^(-1) for some alloys such as Zr65B35.",10.1016/j.matdes.2022.111242,B35Zr65,10000000,K/s,7
"A kinetic transition from peritectic crystallization to amorphous solidification of rapidly quenched refractory Nb-Ni alloy. The TTT curves also show that at small undercooling and low cooling rate, the primary (Nb) phase will preferentially nucleate; conversely, as the undercooling and cooling rate increases, the peritectic Nb7Ni6 phase will directly precipitate from the liquid Nb54Ni46 alloy. Additionally, based on the TTT diagram, the critical cooling rate R c for the formation of amorphous phase is calculated to be 1.71 × 10^(7) K/s.",10.1016/j.actamat.2022.118127,Nb54Ni46,17100000,K/s,7.23299611
"Thermodynamics and kinetics of glassy and liquid phase-change materials. Yamada et al. [25] showed that the duration is 40 ns with a laser power 8 mW and is reduced to about half of it with higher laser powers due to an increase in temperature. Thus, τ x * is taken as the shortest duration about 20 ns for Ge1Sb2Te4, corresponding to a critical cooling rate R c ~(T m -T g )/τ x *≈10^(10) K s^(-1) required for vitrifying Ge-Sb-Te.",10.1016/j.mssp.2021.106094,Ge1Sb2Te4,10000000000,K/s,10
"Elastic and structural properties of Mg25Al75 binary metallic glass under different cooling conditions. Using MD methods, Qi et al. [38] studied the atomic structure of PdNi using various cooling rates (10^(11) K/s, 5 × 10^(11) K/s, 6 × 10^(11) K/s and 10^(13) K/s) and observed that the retention of the amorphous structure of the PdNi3 requires extremely high cooling rates. They found that the critical cooling rate to obtain an amorphous structure is 6 × 10^(11) K/s.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161979,Ni3Pd1,6.00E+11,K/s,11.77815125
"Elastic and structural properties of Mg25Al75 binary metallic glass under different cooling conditions. We have also found that using low and high quenching rates, the values of the elastic properties (Young and shear modulus) are no affected and almost conserved during all annealing times. Finally, from all these results, we suggested that the quenching rate of 10 12 K / s behaves as a critical quenching rate adopted for annealed process of the studied system.",10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.161979,Al75Mg25,1.00E+12,K/s,12
